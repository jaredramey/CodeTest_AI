Ronaware studio code test:

AI specifications -
1) An enemy on patrol
2) An enemy spotting the player and giving chase and shooting
3) An enemy losing the character and giving up after a while
4) An enemy resuming its original patrol

TODO:
1. Create a small level that has walls to break line of sight.
2. Create a Patrol script that makes the AI go from point to point.
   (Could probably reuse some old code for adding new points in editor.)
3. Create a Pursuit script that makes the AI chase the player.
   (Or at least moves to the last known sighting of the player.)
4. Create a Sense script for sight and sound that lets the AI chase player
   when it "hears" or "sees" the player.
5. Create the base AI script that uses Patrol and Pursuit scripts and dictates
   how the AI behaves based on sight and sound.
6. Create a basic player controller that allows for a user to run through the level.
   | Controls for player:                                        |
   | W - Move forward        Ctrl - Crouch (To prevent noise)    |
   | A - Move left           F - Drop a "cigarette"              |
   | S - Move backward                                           |
   | D - move right                                              |
7. (Wish list) Add a mechanic that distracts the AI when the player drops a "cigarette".
